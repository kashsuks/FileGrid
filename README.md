# FileGrid

FileGrid is meant to be a file organizer for my extremely messy and uncategorized Downloads directory.

I wanted it to sort and format all the files in my Downloads folder. Most importantly, my osu! files, videos, documents (.pdf) and images as well.

It uses PyQt6 along with the QtDarkTheme for a nice ui that I would enjoy using
